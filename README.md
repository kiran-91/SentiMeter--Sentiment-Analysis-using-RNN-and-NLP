# SentiMeterðŸŽ¦ -Sentiment Analysis using RNN and NLP 

## Project Overview
This project uses a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis movie reviews. The model classifies reviews as positive or negative based on the text input.

## Features
1. Uses the IMDB dataset for training and testing
2. Simple RNN model with embedding and dense layers
3. Streamlit app for user-friendly input and output
4. Real-time sentiment analysis and prediction score display
5. Review history tracking and display

## Requirements
1. Python 
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Streamlit
5. Tensorflow/Keras
6. nltk

## Installation 
To run the project locally, follow these steps
1. Clone the repository
```cmd
git clone https://https://github.com/kiran-91/SentiMeter-Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd SentiMeter-Sentiment-Analysis
```
2. Setup a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```cmd
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```
3. Install required dependencies
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the Streamlit app
```cmd
streamlit run app.py
```

## Results 
If you're on Team Lazy like me and would rather skip all the tasks, no worriesâ€”just kick back and check out the Streamlit app right here!
```cmd

```

## Usage 
1. Run the Streamlit app
2. Enter a movie review in the text area
3. Click the "Classify the review" button
4. View the sentiment analysis result and prediction score
5. Explore review history and sample reviews
